## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Understand **customer demographics** (age, income, education, family size, etc.)  
- Analyze **product preferences** across categories (wine, meat, gold, sweets, etc.)  
- Evaluate the **effectiveness of past campaigns**  
- Segment customers into groups for targeted marketing  
- Provide **data-driven insights** to improve campaign performance

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values & outliers  
   - Converted categorical variables to factors  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Income distribution by age & education  
   - Spending patterns by product type  
   - Correlation between income & spending  

3. **Campaign Performance**  
   - Success rate of campaigns  
   - Customer acceptance by income/age groups  

4. **Customer Segmentation (Clustering)**  
   - K-means clustering on spending behavior  
   - Identification of high-value customer segments  

5. **Visualization**  
   - Histograms, bar charts, scatterplots  
   - Cluster visualization

## 📌 Key Insights
- Younger customers prefer **sweets & meat products**, while older customers spend more on **wine**.  
- High-income customers responded positively to premium product campaigns.  
- Campaign success was highest among **middle-aged, married customers** with moderate-to-high income.  
- Clustering revealed **3 main customer groups**:  
  - **Budget Shoppers** – low spend, low campaign acceptance  
  - **Average Consumers** – moderate spend across categories  
  - **Premium Buyers** – high income, loyal to campaigns
